>A web application in progress for a home-brew D20 character tracker. Built in Java and Node.js and hosted on Heroku in separate instances
>The overall goal of this application is to strength my Java skills and to have a working application in the end. Maybe eventually take the Java application to an Android and iOS application that will be paired with the homebrew starter kit.
>
>In the end, this application will be able to help track your character, make basic dice rolls for you, and allow you to digitally save multiple characters for ease of access.
